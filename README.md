There are 2 ways to run:
1) `python3 noteplan_script.py`
2) Navigate to `dist\noteplan_script` and run the executable. The executable was build with PyInstaller to create a stand
   alone version for people that do not have a Python enviroment set up.

This script was developed for use with Python 3.7 on MacOS. It will not work with Python 2.7 or on Windows.
